    <p>Hi! I am currently a 3rd year Cognitive Science student at the University of Edinburgh. I am enthusiastic about the subject that
    I am studying right now. I am interested in exploring what it takes to have a mind. What are the fundamental building blocks of the mind? 
    How are these building blocks put together to form a mind? To answer such questions, I believe that it
    is necessary to integrate knowledge from various disciplines... </p>
