    <p>Hi! I am currently a 3rd year Cognitive Science student at the University of Edinburgh. I am interested in exploring what it takes to build a mind. What are the fundamental building blocks, if any, of the mind? 
    How are these building blocks put together to form a mind? To answer these questions, I believe that it
    is necessary to integrate knowledge from various disciplines... </p>
